Thanks for your interest in the NetAuth project.  If you want to
contact the developers, you can get in touch in several ways.

  * You can join us on FreeNode in `#netauth` and `#netauth-dev`.
  * You can open an issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/NetAuth/NetAuth/issues)
  * You can send us an email at `contact@netauth.org`

If you're contacting with information about a bug, please make sure
that you can report accurate information about the fault.  You may be
asked to run specific tests or compile test binaries.

If you're reporting a security vulnerability, be careful to not post
them to GitHub.  Contact via email or IRC and a secure channel will be
established.
