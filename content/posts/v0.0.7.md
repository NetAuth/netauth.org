Version 0.0.7 is released.

With this release TLS defaults to on for both client and server.
Certificates must be provided for the server, and the client must have
the certificate available for verification.  Users that wish to
disable this critical security mechanism (which is the only thing
preventing passwords from being sent in the clear!) can use the
`--PWN_ME` option on the client and server to disable TLS.

Full changelog for this version below:
