Yet another git tag.

Version 0.0.3 has been released to github.  This version includes
group support on part with the /etc/groups file in terms of
functionality.  Clustering is now supported via external sync of the
data layer as well.

There will be a point release between here and 0.0.4 which will
include some refactoring and cleanup to fix some architectural
problems in the current design.
