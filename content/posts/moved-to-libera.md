In what should come as a shock to no-one, NetAuth is leaving the
freenode network.  The conduct of its new leadership is not in line
with the way the NetAuth project is run, and the beauty of IRC is that
its a neutral protocol, so any network implementing the standard can
pass messages.

NetAuth has retained the same channels, namespaces, and cloaks with
Libera.  Feel free to drop by and say hello in our new channels.
