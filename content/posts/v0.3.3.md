Patch release v0.3.3 improves the interface for additional
applications that wish to consume the NetAuth interface.  The default
token cache is now supplied automatically by the `pkg/netauth`
library, and it is not necessary to import it manually.

Changes from 0.3.2:

```text
* 3ee53f7 - (tag: v0.3.3) cmd/netauth: Set default token cache as filesystem
* c3aea81 - pkg/netauth: Refactor token cache to sub-package
```
