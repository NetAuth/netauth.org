Version 0.0.3.1 has been released to github.

This version includes the rework to use tokens instead of repeat ID
and secret, which should dramatically increase the throughput of
modifications on the server.  Token keys are stored in standard PEM
format and the server will generate them for use if they are not
available on first launch.
