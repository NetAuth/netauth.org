A wild git tag appears!

Version 0.0.1 is released to GitHub.  This version contains the
minimum possible code to be remotely useful.  Capabilities in this
version are the ability to bootstrap a server, add new entities, and
authenticate them.  There's really not much more to say than there's
now a server up and available.
