Release 0.1.1 has been posted to GitHub.  This is a bugfix release,
and resolves a problem whereby the server would not return more than
10 entities or groups in a single search request.

This release also improves the capabilities for local testing by
inverting the config file search path order, such that a config file
in the local directory will be preferred over the system config.

As always, the changelog is shown below:

```
* 2490d9b - (tag: v0.1.1) db/util: return 16k search results
* 2761805 - cmd: invert find order for config files
```
