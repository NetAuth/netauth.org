Another git tag!

Version 0.0.2 is released to GitHub.  This version contains basic
group support, the ability to change secrets, and persistent storage.
Metadata can also be updated and there's a handy sorted list of the
available subcommands.

Of note is that this release drops the concept of dual keyed entities
and groups.  Up to this point entities and groups were indexed by the
string name and the numeric ID.  This was getting cumbersome to keep
up with and so the numeric index is gone.  It will likely come back in
the future as a higher level index, but the primary key is the string
ID.
