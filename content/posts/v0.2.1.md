Version 0.2.1 has been released and is a critical security update.
Due to a flaw in the implementation of the SearchEntities method in
the tree package, an attacker could exfiltrate an unredacted copy of
the entity database.  This would be difficult for an organization to
detect, as tools like nsscache perform full searches regularly.

The bug has been present since version 0.0.12, and affects all
versions until 0.2.1.  The complete list is as follows:

  * 0.0.12
  * 0.0.13
  * 0.1.0
  * 0.1.1
  * 0.1.2
  * 0.1.3
  * 0.1.4
  * 0.2.0


Version 0.0.12 was originally released on 2018-12-16.

The changelog, however short, is included below for v0.2.1:

```
* 9030c1c - (tag: v0.2.1) internal/tree: Ensure searched entities are sanitized
```
