Version 0.1.4 has been released to GitHub.  It is recommended that all
users upgrade to this version as soon as possible to fix a potential
data corruption bug.

Other notable features in this release include environment variables
to specify the default entity and to provide the secret to
`netauth(1)`, improved status information in server pings, and pretty
printing for NetAuth capabilities.  Additionally in this release the
permissions for modifying entity keys have been adjusted, and it is
now possible for an entity to modify their own keys.

As always, the changelog is below:

```
* 31afd20 - (tag: v0.1.4) internal/ctl: pretty printing for capabilities
* f32bbd6 - internal/ctl: Allow pulling entity and secret from environment
* 80e208f - internal/db/protodb: Fix disk access race
* 7f6612c - internal/rpc: pass more information back with ping
* b7981ea - internal/rpc: Permit entity keys to be changed by owning entity
```
