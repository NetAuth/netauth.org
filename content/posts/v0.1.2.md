Version 0.1.2 has been released to GitHub.  This release contains a
handful of bug-fixes and resolves a regression whereby the lock and
unlock commands were inadvertently removed from the CLI.

This release also includes security improvements in the form of
reduced lifetime tokens, and an upgraded version of gRPC.  Though the
field was never used, this release also removes the renewals_remaining
field from tokens, as tokens are now non-renewable items.

As always, the changelog is provided below:

```
* 6260bb1 - (tag: v0.1.2) internal/ctl: entity locking, resolves #4
* 3c113ab - cmd/netauthd: reduce default token lifetime to 10 minutes
* ad28706 - internal/token: tokens are not renewable
* a6b27dc - go.mod: upgrade to new version of grpc
```
