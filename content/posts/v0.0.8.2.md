Now that NetAuth is properly released, bug reports have showed up.
This release cleans up the functions that ask for secrets so that they
aren't typed in plaintext on the command line, as well as cleaning up
the logic that verifies tokens.

As always the changelist is below:

```
* 7da8155 - (tag: v0.0.8.2) Client: Check for keys before inspecting tokens
* bcdba6d - Change default entity in EntityInfoCmd and ChangeSecretCmd
* 256b886 - Prompt for secret
* 911b6cf - Fix incorrect implementation of the modify-keys cmdlet
```
