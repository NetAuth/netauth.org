Another release, another few bugs.  This release sets the default
entity ID to the system username of the running user (generally the
right thing) and sets the default location for token keys.

As always the changelog for this release is below:

```
* 91ae1a0 - (tag: v0.0.8.3) Return system username as entity
* b3fbaea - Set default location of token keys
```
