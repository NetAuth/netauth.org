Release v0.3.4 is a patch release that further improves the experience
of consumers of the NetAuth library and generally improves logging on
the NetAuth server.  Loggers must now be passed explicitly, and a new
startup deferral mechanism allows actions which previously happened in
`init()` to now happen after logging is known to be initialized.
