The 0.0.8 series seemed that it would never end, but all good things
must end eventually.  Fortunately there's a 0.0.9 release now to
celebrate!  This release improves the standardization of words in the
commands as well as improves upon the print options in various cmdlets
handling entities and groups.

As always, here's the changelog:

```
* 9f4abd6 - (tag: v0.0.9) ctl: Make field matching case insensitive
* fb3adac - Standardize verbs in commands
* 50ea351 - Use options rather than ring selectors
* a22131d - Standardize usage of entity/group flags
```
