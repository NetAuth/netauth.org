Version 0.4.0 is now generally available.  This release adds support
for the newer kv2 key-value attributes on entities and groups, and
will be the last release branch to support the older untyped metadata
format.

This release also includes the rebuilt backend for storage, which has
temporarily dropped support for running multiple copies on highly
available filesystems.  This was never truly supported, and really
worked by luck.  The new backend makes it much easier to build a
backend on top of generic key-value storage technologies such as etcd,
so a true storage backend is on the horizon that will satisfy HA
requirements.

Finally, v0.4.0 changes some of the logic used to load files like
certificates and public keys relative to the configuration file rather
than relative to the data directory.  In practical terms it is
sufficient to copy your `tls.pem` and `token.pem` to `/etc/netauth`
and no longer provide `/var/lib/netauth` on client machines.
